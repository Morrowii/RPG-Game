# RPG-Game

A simple RPG game that was developed to practice and demonstrate my skills, and hopefully provide a little fun too!

Select your character by clicking on their picture. In the same way, select your first opponent.

Click the "Attack" button to attack the your opponent. Your opponent will immediately counter-attack. Continue attacking until either your character's or your opponent's health reaches 0. 

If your character's health reaches 0, you lose. If your opponent's health reaches 0, you will be able to select your next opponent. 

You must defeat 3 opponents in order to win the game. Don't worry, your attack power will increase the more you attack, giving you a fighting chance.

Each character has a different amount of health and attack power, so choose wisely!
